         <h2>Hello.</h2>
         <p>Mark Boulton Design was a small design studio. In 2014, <span>we
         were acquired by Monotype.</span></p>
         <p>Over the years, we <span>built an amazing team</span> and worked on some
         <span>tremendous projects with the smartest clients.</span> That's something
         we're proud of, and thankful for. But, it's time for a change.</p>
         <p>The move to Monotype brings us closer to the problems we
         want to fix. Mark Boulton Design is now closed. The team will
         be working on Monotype projects from the same premises in the
         UK and we'll still be writing, still blogging, and still
         speaking at web conferences. We're not going anywhere.</p>
